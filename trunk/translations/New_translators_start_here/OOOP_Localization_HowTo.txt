I. User Interface elements of OxygenOffice Professional
-------------------------------------------------------


1) Download the most currenct localization for OpenOffice.org Premium from here:
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=170021&package_id=202806

2) Unpack it into your workdir

3) Edit the OpenOffice.org Calc files (ODS) with Calc or if you are expert you can
   edit SDF files directly with a good UTF-8 capable editor

4) You have to edit two files:

   * master-gallery.ods
   * master-patches.ods

5) The basic rules of edition:

   a) Every files have English (en-US) lines do NOT tuch them... 
   b) You can translate every second line where J column = "[YourLangID]" (without quotes).
   c) You can simply search and replace [YourLangID] string to yout language ID for example hu, de, en-UK, etc.
   d) Translate the K column to your language from english text

6) Rename the files

   * master-gallery.ods to <yourlanguageID>-gallery.ods
   * master-patches.ods to <yourlanguageID>-patches.ods

   NOTE: "<yourlanguageID>" (without quotes) is your language ID for example hu, de, en-UK, etc.

7) Save your files as csv file (Files -> Save as -> Filetype: Text CSV (.csv)

   * Enable "Edit filter settings" option
   
   a) Character set   : Unicode (UTF-8)
   b) Field delimiter : {Tab}
   c) Text Delimiter  : (none) [Delete the current settings]
   d) Disable "Save cell settings as shown" option

8) Rename the files

   * master-gallery.csv to <yourlanguageID>-gallery.sdf
   * master-patches.csv to <yourlanguageID>-patches.sdf

II. Translated templates for OxygenOffice Professional
------------------------------------------------------


Afrer you have successfully translated the additional UI elements of OxygenOffice Professional you can collect templates for your language. Professional, easy to use and correct templates will extend the user exparience of OxygenOffice Professional. Se these alaments are assential for OxygenOffice professional. You can create new templates or translate templates from other languages. Also you can collect templates in your language around you. One important thing is they should be licensed under free license like PDL, PD, LGPL, CC.

If you have good templates in your language (or gallery elements) under free license please send it to me.

To make my work easier please follow the next rules:

1) Please collect OpenOffice.org license compatible templates in your language and short them into these categories...

officorr -> "Business Correspondence"
offimisc -> "Other Business Documents"
personal -> "Personal Correspondence and Documents"
forms -> "Forms and Contracts"
finance -> "Finances"
educate -> "Education"
layout -> "Presentation Backgrounds"
presnt -> "Presentations"
misc -> "Miscellaneous"

NOTE: layout for Impress backgrounds, presnt for Impress prewritten presentations

2) Then zip (or 7zip) it and send it to me.
