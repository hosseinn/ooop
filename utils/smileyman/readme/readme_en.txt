This extension is as free as all open source software, but it's content, the graphic design, is only free for personal use.

“Smileyman” provides around 400 Emoticons, but they are different: Good old Smiley has got hands and feet to show body-language and even sex, so to say as Smileyman and Smileywoman. After installing, you may type for instance  “happy”, “woman” or “striptease” and pop-up windows instantly offer equivalent icons – just  press the return-key. 

As “icon-typing” does not start until the third letter, words with only one or two letters are displayed in the pop-up window only while adding “-icon” such as “I-icon”, “we-icon” and so on.

Typing small or capital letters doesn't matter.

Install Smileyman extensions: open the menu “Tools > Extension Manager”

After installing make sure that the checkbox “Display remainder...” in the menu “Edit > Autotext” is enabled.

Animations may slow down, depending on your PC

Disabling Smileman extensions: open the menu “Tools > Extension Manager” 
(It works only after restartin OpenOffice).

Smileyman58 will be provided in a different extension.
