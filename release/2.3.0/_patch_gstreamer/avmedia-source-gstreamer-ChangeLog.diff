+
+	* gstplayer.cxx (processSyncMessage): remember GstXOverlay
+	(processMessage): explicit expose when we reach paused state -
+	this mean that now once stream is loaded/video inserted, the 1st
+	frame is rendered
+	(setMediaTime): if not playing set PAUSED state again, seems like
+	seek is changing state to PLAYING. this fixes problem when stop
+	seeked to begin and started playing again
+
+2006-09-21  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>
+
+	* gstplayer.cxx (processSyncMessage): when error occurs, set the
+	condition so that OOo does'n waste time waiting for us to finish
+	reaching PAUSED state
+
+2006-09-19  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>
+
+	* gstplayer.cxx (processSyncMessage): set condition even if we
+	weren't able to get video size - might be audio only stream
+	(getPreferredPlayerWindowSize): init size to 0, 0 - in case we
+	don't have video size, it will fallback to system media window
+	content (some icon)
+
+2006-08-31  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>
+
+	* gstplayer.cxx (processSyncMessage): when we get to paused state,
+	get stream-info from playbin and look for video size. set
+	condition when done
+	(Player): added width, height, size condition
+	(preparePlaybin): new helper method, extracted from create
+	method. use fake video sink in the beggining so that we don't get
+	xwindow-id message too early
+	(getPreferredPlayerWindowSize): wait for size condition to be sure
+	we know video size (if possible). reset video sink to default one
+	(NULL) and set state to READY and immediatelly to PAUSE so that
+	the default sink is relinked
+
+2006-08-16  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>
+
+	* gstplayer.cxx (create): set state to PAUSED so that we can query
+	duration ASAP
+	(processMessage): watch for state changed and query duration when
+	going to PAUSED state
+
+2006-08-15  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>
+
+	* makefile.mk: require gstreamer-plugins-base-0.10 and link with
+	gst interfaces library
+
+	* gstwindow.cxx: make it build
+
+	* gstplayer.cxx: removed WINNT ifdefs (relict from time when I
+	thought Cedric develops on win architecture)
+	(gst_pipeline_bus_callback): added sync handler for setting
+	xwindow id to to video sink
+	(processSyncMessage): new metrhod, process message from sync
+	handler
+	(create): set playbin state to READY so that playback start is
+	faster
+	(createPlayerWindow): implemented, we pass xwindow id in 3rd
+	argument
+
+2006-08-04  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>
+
+	* gstplayer.cxx (create): add bus watch, watch for EOS in
+	processMessage method (called from watch callback)
+
+2006-08-02  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>
+
+	* gstplayer.cxx: test for mpPlaybin != NULL before using it,
+	initialize it in constructor to NULL and also reset it to NULL
+	after unrefing
+	(getDuration): check for sucessful query and the right format
+	(getMediaTime): ditto, 
+	(setMediaTime): implemented
+
+2006-08-01  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>
+
+	* gstwindow.hxx: removed mpWndClass for now, so that the rest
+	compiles
+
+	* gstuno.cxx (component_getFactory): s/DirectX/GStreamer so that
+	component is loaded
+
+	* gstplayer.cxx (Player::Player): do not create gerror object, it
+	is noit needed, free the error object only if created during
+	initialization of gstremer
+	(Player::create, start, stop): use g_main_loop only on windows
+	(create): fixed ascURL declaration, added rtl namespace prefix
+	(setMute): set mbMuted
+	(setVolumeDB): convert avmedia volume to gstreamer volume, added
+	missing NULL to the end of g_object_set call
+	(getVolumeDB): convert gstreamer volume back to avmedia volume
+
+	* gstplayer.hxx: keep g_main_loop only on win platform. make
+	mnUnmutedVolume double, moved mbInitialized to the end to quiet
+	compiler warning
+
+	* gstcommon.hxx: removed wrong #include <rtl/ustring>
+
+	* renamed source files, prefixed the names with gst so that obj
+	file names do not clash with xine object files
+
+	* makefile.mk: changed PRJNAME and TARGET to reflect
+	gstreamer. enabled build on unix as well. removed win library
+	references. removed source files which are not yet ported from
+	SLOFILES list.
+
