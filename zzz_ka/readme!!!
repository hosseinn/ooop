Hi Kami,

This files are for Georgian OOOP

ka.sdf - UI100% translated (GIA Edition - www.gia.ge)

As for Helpcontent - General (files in helpcontent2/source/text/root), schart, simpress, smath - FINISHED
Other modules - progress (about 30% done)
Not included in this sdf yet.

!!!
There is one BIG problem for us
GSI_ka.sdf file in Your SVN is not our (GIA) file but from "ooo georgean nl"
That translation is not Georgian at all (from my point of view of course)
!!!

we'll be very happy if You will use our translation for OOOP
addsdf-ka.sh could be used for it
!!! There could be possible minor problems with SDF file - it is generated for OOF680_m15

If accepted:
We're going to produce special pack for Georgian release:
Georgian unicode fonts
Georgian maps
Photos (Nature, Architecture, etc.)
etc.

If not accepted:
Anyway, we're going to produce our own builds in future.
And our intention to use Your product as base.
So - to avoid violation of rights - would You be so kind to explain what are/could be requirements for such cases?

If You decide to use "ooo georgean nl" translation and, anyway, help us - than:
1. after building
2. addsdf-ka.sh
3-4. linux-ka.sh & win-ka.sh will take abot 1 hour each for producing builds with our translation.
 

Best regards,
g.\
